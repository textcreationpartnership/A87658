            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair and abſurd to alledge any thing upon a man which are not either his expreſs words, or the plain and manifeſt ſence of them, obvious to every intelligent and impartial Reader: For, to alledge a conſequential ſenſe of a mans words, which they will no wayes bear, is moſt uncivil and inhumane, and argueth at moſt a weak and deſperate Cauſe, when ye are put to uſe ſuch mean and unlawful Arts to make your part ſeem fair.

But that ye may with ſome ſeeming ſhow, appear to looſe the <hi>Knot,</hi> ye word my Argument quite another way, <hi>I Infants may be ſaved by the working of the Spirit in them, why may not the</hi> Gentiles <hi>be ſo, by giving obedience to the Light in them?</hi> And thus ye would make me appear to the <hi>ignorant</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:137547:68"/> as if I did plead, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were or could be ſaved without faith in Chriſt, and the regenerating Spirit of Chriſt, only by obedience to the general dictates of the Light within; but I ſay, though none are ſaved, but who are obedient to the Light in them, yet no Obedience can ſave, without faith in Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt regenerating them, that is altogether neceſſary to every mans eternal Salvation.</p>
               <p>Whereas I produced divers very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Arguments to prove, That the Light in men that did accuſe or reprove for ſin, could not be ſome natural faculty of mans Soul; theſe Arguments ſome of them ye paſs over very ſlightly, anſwering by your bare Affirmations, without proof, and ſome ye give no anſwer unto at all, nor take any notice of, ſee my Book, p. 119, 120, 121. which I again recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Readers ſerious conſideration.

And though <hi>Paul</hi> call the Law <hi>weak,</hi> yet it is to be conſidered, that he calleth it not ſo abſolutely, or of it ſelf, but weak through the fleſh, becauſe the fleſh or nature of man is weak to fulfill it, until Chriſt be revealed in the ſecond Miniſtration of him, to fulfill the Righteouſneſs of the Law; And if ye were not very partial, ye might have underſtood, by what I charged againſt you in

For though the Law be weak, comparatively, yet that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, that it hath no ability to work or beget any good thing in men: A weak man or Child can do ſome good things; and tho' mans corrupted Nature can of it ſelf do no good thing, yet this inward Law and Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even in its firſt appearance, can and doth help the corrupt Nature of man, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if not wholly to cleanſe it, and being cleanſed, to enable it to do ſome good things, which God doth not wholly reject, but in part accept, in and through Chriſt; and indeed <hi>Paul,</hi> as he uſeth divers Allegories and Figures whereby to hold forth the ſervice and uſe of the Law to men, before Faith came, as that of a <hi>School-maſter,</hi> and that of a <hi>firſt Husband,</hi> ſo that of a Cuſtody or place of Refuge, like the City of Refuge that was appointed for the Man-ſlayer to hide himſelf in from the Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Blood, where he might remain, as in Priſon, yet ſafe, until the Death of the High-Prieſt, as doth plainly appear from <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.23. <hi>But before Faith came we were kept under the Law,</hi> (which <hi>Beza,</hi> a <hi>French Proteſtant,</hi> tanſlateth in his Latine Tranſlation, <hi>ſub Legis preſidie,</hi> i. e. <hi>the ſafeguard or defence of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> doth well bear it) <hi>ſhut up</hi> (as

And whereas it is the outward and natural Sun that conſtitutes common and natural Days, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did <hi>Origine, Auguſtine,</hi> and many others conclude, That the ſeven Days, mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. could not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and natural Days, for there was no Sun until the fourth Day, nor Firmament until the ſecond, nor dry Land and Sea till the third.</p>
               <p>P. 147. <hi>That God altered the Sabbath from the Seventh Day to the Firſt,</hi> ye meerly alledge, without any proof, as your common manner is. I ſuppoſe ye are not ſo ignorant as not to know that <hi>Calvin,</hi> the Father, ſo called, or Founder of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Church, and the <hi>French Proteſtants</hi> generally, and alſo the <hi>Dutch,</hi> tho' they keep the Firſt Day for worſhip, after the manner of primitive Chriſtians, as we alſo do, yet do not judge it to be the Sabbath, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by divine Inſtitution; &amp; we ſet apart that day worthily and commendably, with other Proteſtants, neither for any betterneſs in it, ſimply as a Day, nor as being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a Sabbath, but in honour of our Saviours Reſurrection, after the Example of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians in the Apoſtles days, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, and that we ſee a great conveniency and ſervice in it, to keep a Day
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:137547:102"/> weekly unto the Lord, and as ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>He who keepeth a Day, keepeth it unto the Lord,</hi> and that Day rather than another, becauſe of Chriſts Reſurrection on the firſt day of the week, and the worthy Example of primitive Chriſtians, recorded in Scripture.</p>
               <p>And thus I have gone through all the Heads contained in your Book, relating to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part, and have showed our agreement in every one of them, with the holy Scriptures, and alſo with famous Proteſtants, and Antient Writers, call'd <hi>Chriſtian Fathers,</hi> except in that one matter of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> wherein if we differ from many of theſe called Antients in one thing, ye differ in another; for they generally judged it abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which ye, as well as I, judge an Error in them, and theſe called <hi>Baptiſts</hi> commonly, who may be judged as good Proteſtants as ye, deny your <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as a humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet ye have no other: And if this doth not unchriſtian them, ſo nor can it us; and ye deny their baptizing into Water ſuch, who have been baptized, when Infants; why then may ye not allow the ſame Charity to us, that ye, <hi>viz.</hi> the more fober part both of <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> and <hi>Baptists,</hi> ſo called (tho' the more Rigid ſort call one another <hi>Hereticks</hi>) allow one to another, and that we allow to the ſober, and tender, and honeſt hearted of you both,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:137547:103"/> yea, and to ſuch in all Profeſſions, where the Head and Foundation is held, which is Chriſt? &amp; we have that Charity, that there is a ſincere ſort among all Profeſſions, who belong to God and Chriſt, and tho' they have wrong Notions and Conceptions of ſome things belonging to <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> and have not a form of ſound words, in delivering ſome matters of Faith, which is a great hurt unto them, yet they have ſome true inward ſence of Chriſtian Truth and Doctrine, and their faith and ſence may be partly ſound, where their words, where by they expreſs it may be very unſound; for many have a right ſence and feeling of things, whereof they have not a right Elocution, Utterance and form of Speech, as in Naturals, ſo in Spirituals, as when Men taſte Money, and their taſte of it is the ſame, yet they differ in the Names they give it, or in ſome ſubtile and curious Queſtions about the Nature of it, or the nature and manner of taſting it, that is not ſo very material. So men may have ſome real ſence and experience of the workings of the holy Spirit, &amp; inward divine Revelations and Inſpirations, that work and beget in them ſome meaſure of true Faith, Hope, Love, and other Chriſtian Virtues, and yet by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of Education, and wrong outward tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, or ill wording of things, may give wrong Names to things, yet God forbid we ſhould unchriſtian them, ſimply for a Miſtake,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:137547:103"/> or defect in not giving proper words &amp; names to things; and yet many things of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, among ſingle hearted men, lie but in words, and ſuch ſhould have a regard to that which is good, tender and ſenſible one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where it is felt: But where a perſecuting and malitious Spirit, and great hardneſs of Heart prevaileth in any, theſe are not to be regarded as Chriſtians, whatever they profeſs. So I would have you all to know, all the ſober and tender hearted People of <hi>New-England,</hi> and elſe-where, whether called <hi>Presbyterian, Independent, Baptist,</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> yea, and others, holding the Head, and being ſincere in the main, That we can, and do own that your ſincerity, altho' we cannot but differ from you in matters both of Doctrine and Practice, wherein we find you to err from the path of Truth, and ſo far as we have together attained and are agreed in all good things of Chriſtian Doctrine or Practice, let us walk by the ſame Rule, and live in Charity one with another.</p>
               <p>Pag. 148. In your Reflections on that I call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>A Call and Warning to the People of Boſton, &amp;c.</hi> firſt, ye falſly charge me, <hi>That I arrogate as much to my ſelf, as any of the Prophets of Old had, of an immediate Miſſion from God.</hi> But let that Paper be conſidered, and it ſhall not be found that I arrogate or aſſume any thing equal to the Prophets of Old, only I did, and I
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:137547:104"/> do ſtill affirm, That I had the Word of the Lord to declare to the People of <hi>Boſton, &amp;c.</hi> and it was as a burden unto me, until I had delivered it; &amp; he who hath not Gods Word, as it liveth and is the Word of Life in his heart, is no true Miniſter of Chriſt, but every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt is not either Apoſtle or Prophet, in that high and eminent ſence that is frequent in Scripture. Ye charge me with, 1ſt. <hi>Lying,</hi> 2dly, <hi>Slandering,</hi> 3dly, <hi>Railing,</hi> 4thly, <hi>Falſe Doctrine,</hi> 5thly, <hi>Non-ſence;</hi> but all this ye alledge without proof, as your manner is: Sharp Speeches are not Railing always, but commendable in ſome caſes; for both Chriſt, and the Prophets and Apoſtles uſed them to men of your Generation, &amp; your Speeches are more ſharp againſt me &amp; my Friends than ours are againſt you; and which are moſt deſerving, we freely leave it to the Lord, and his Witneſs in mens Conſciences. Ye would ſix <hi>Non-ſence</hi> on my words, that I ſaid, <hi>Your Self-actings of all ſorts, in that ye call your Duties and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, ye are to repent of, &amp;c.</hi> Where it is clear, by that <hi>ye call your Duties,</hi> I did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, (and ſo might ye) your <hi>Preaching, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Singing without the Spirit of God,</hi> and them pag. 149. ye call <hi>Dirt and Dung;</hi> and yet ye continue to offer up this Dirt and Dung unto God, but remember that God will caſt the Dirt &amp; Dung of your Sacrifices on your faces, and the Dung of your ſolemn Feaſts, according
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:137547:104"/> to <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.3. And ſurely, ſeeing by your own confeſſion, <hi>your Prayers are Dirt and Dung,</hi> they cannot be that pure Offering which God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his People ſhould offer up unto him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. 6thly, Ye ſay, <hi>Prophets do not uſe to call men to Repent of their holding the Truth as it is in Jeſus, and his Call is nothing elſe. Anſ.</hi> I bid you not Repent for your holding the Truth in Jeſus; for that is falſe, ye hold it not in Jeſus, but as ye hold many Errors in Doctrine, ſo ye hold ſomething of Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. and I bid you Repent of your <hi>Hypocriſie, Pride, Vanity, Blaſphemy, hard Speeches, Cruelty,</hi> &amp;c. 7thly, Ye ſay, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had wont to ſhow ſome proof of their Call;</hi> but ye alledge, <hi>I have ſhown none;</hi> but ye have not told what proof they uſed to ſhow, or what proof <hi>John,</hi> a great Prophet, ſhowed to the Phariſees, for he wrought no Miracles; their ordinary proof was, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Let the Lord be Witneſs,</hi> and this is my proof, who do not equal my ſelf to any of thoſe Prophets; it ſufficeth, that I am one of the leaſt of the Servants of Chriſt. But it is hard to prove a thing to be White to a blind man, or that I ſpeak to a deaf man: When ye can prove, that ye have Ears to hear what God ſaith in his Servants, or that your Ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:137547:105"/> Lord hath not ſpoken,</hi> when he did ſpeak. I ſay it with Sorrow, if ye were not blind, ye might ſee ſome of the Judgments of the Lord begun to be executed upon you, which I was made, with great ſorrow to declare, I did feel were to come upon the People both of <hi>Boſton</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> if they did not ſpeedily Repent; &amp; though Ye have not conſidered and laid it to heart, yet ſome have, and more I hope will, for their Amendment; but as for me, I have not deſired the Evil Day to come upon you, but greatly deſire, if it be the good will of God, that ye may find Mercy to Repent, and ſo his Wrath that is began to kindle againſt you, may be quenched. And though I told you, <hi>That whatever Doctrine cannot be proved from Scripture, is to be rejected, whatever pretence men may make to Immediate Revelation;</hi> yet this doth not reach me, for I bring no Doctrine but what I prove from Scripture; but as for the Call that Gods Servants uſed to have, they proved it not by Scripture, but by the living Voice of God ſpeaking in them, to all who have an Ear open to hear, but your Ear is ſhut, as ſo was <hi>Pharoah's</hi> Ear, againſt God's Call in <hi>Moſes,</hi> though accompanied in him with great Miracles; and as ſome believed, that ſaw no Miracles of old, ſo many did not believe, that did ſee them; and ſo would it be now, if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought.</p>

               <p>In your Appendix, which containeth a poor empty ſhadow of Anſwer to my Letter unto you, I need not take notice of all your Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, nor reply unto them, as judging it loſs of time and paper. Ye ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, <hi>Ye hope, ye have now given a ſatisfactory Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why ye called my Letter a Blaſphemous and Heretical Paper.</hi> But your hope will prove vain, I freely leave it to all that are ſober, and able to judge in theſe matters. 2dly, <hi>Ye think, ye have now found ſpiritual Weapons, if the Word of God be the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 6.17. But the Word of God ye are ignorant of, and alſo of the Scripture that teſtifie of it, and ye have only wreſted and abuſed ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, to defend your bad Cauſe, as I have made ſufficiently already appear. 3dly, Ye ſay, <hi>your preaching is open, and ye ſhut out none, but thoſe that will not come.</hi> But this is a poor excuſe, do ye not deny, to give us a fair hearing, when if any come to anſwer to your falſe accuſations, and gain-ſay your falſe doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, before they can ſpeak one ſentence they are carried away to the Goal? 4thly, Ye alledge, <hi>when I came unto you, your Liberties were taken away.</hi> But this is a notorious Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; ye had all the Liberty that we or I had, or could be deſired: None of your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were diſturbed by them in Authority, nor no Prohibition to hinder you fairly to debate things of Religion, only ye had not power
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:137547:106"/> to perſecute as formerly, and your Sun of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was ſet. 5thly, Ye falſly alledge, <hi>I boaſt of my great Conqueſt;</hi> for I only publiſh your Cowardice. And that ye ſay, <hi>Ye ſuppoſe ye have made my Cake appear to be Dough,</hi> it is but a ſuppoſition, and hath nothing of truth in it. 6thly, Ye ſay, <hi>Ought not the Shepherd to be aware when the Wolf comes to his Flock?</hi> But ſuppoſe I were a Wolf, (as I thank God I am not) when the Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Is this the way to defend your Flock? unleſs ye did judge, that by your open appearing in a publick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, ye would diſcover your weakneſs. 7thly, Ye ſay, <hi>Ye knew I was a</hi> Quaker, <hi>and therefore doubted my deſign.</hi> But I told you plainly what my deſign was, <hi>viz.</hi> To diſcover you to be Teachers of falſe Doctrine in many things. 8thly, Ye ſay, <hi>I give no demonſtration, that I came in the Will of the Lord unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> But ye ſhould ſay, ye are blind, and cannot ſee it, as all falſe Teachers and Perſecuters were, who did not acknowledge that the true Servants of God, who came unto them, were ſent of God. 9thly, Ye falſly, and without all ſhadow of proof, ſay, <hi>It was of God, doubtleſs, to leave him in the hands of Satan, to be thus acted:</hi> I value not your falſe Judgment, further than to pitty your great Blindneſs. 10thly, Ye ſay, <hi>I have ſet you a Preſident,</hi> viz. <hi>To Lye and Rail, but ye
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:137547:106"/> follow it not.</hi> But let all ſober and impartial Readers judge, whether ye have not both Lyed and Railed moſt groſly; and tho' I have uſed ſome ſharp words towards you according to your deſert, as Gods Servants have done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly againſt men of your Spirit, yet my tender Conſcience beareth me witneſs, with the help of God, that I have neither lyed nor railed upon you. 11thly, Ye ſay, <hi>It hath been proved, that I bring another Doctrine, than that of Chriſt.</hi> But ye ſay it, and that is all: And whereas I told you, an Heretick (tho' I am none) ſhould be twice admoniſhed, before he is rejected; Ye anſwer, <hi>Have I not been more than ſo?</hi> But I ſay, I never to this day received Admonition from any Church, <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to due Church Order, as Chriſt hath inſtituted; and though I have had divers De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, ſome in writ, and ſome by word of Mouth, with divers Oppoſers, yet that ſaith nothing that ever I was duely admoniſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Order, nor rejected out of any Church Society; for theſe I had to deal with were only private Perſons; and therefore ye are impertinent to mention, for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, either <hi>John Alexander</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Book I have many years ago anſwer'd in print, and my Anſwer to it is now in <hi>New-England,</hi> or theſe <hi>Baptiſts</hi> (who are judg'd by many of you to be <hi>Hereticks</hi>) at <hi>Barbycan</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> or any at <hi>Hampton;</hi> Publick Diſputes are one thing,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:137547:107"/> and an orderly Church Admonition or Cenſure, is another. But whereas ye mention <hi>Salem,</hi> your inſinuation faileth you, I writ a fair Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Prieſts at <hi>Salem,</hi> to have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them before the People, but they refuſed, and I had no further medling with them. And tho' ye grant that Chriſt and the Apoſtles diſputed with men of ill Principles, yet ye muſt not diſpute with me, <hi>becauſe I am worſe than any of thoſe, and grown beyond Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition:</hi> But this is your bare alledgance, and none will believe you, but who are blinded with the ſame Prejudice as ye are. But ye give me no Anſwer, why though ye will not receive <hi>Quakers</hi> into your Houſes, yet ſome of your ſort will receive their Goods, taken from them by force, becauſe they could not for Conſcience ſake give you Maintenance. <hi>That your preaching in your publick Houſes, are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted means of our Conviction,</hi> ye take for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without proof; nor can we believe you, ſo long as ye are declared Enemies to the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit of Truth, that doth only qualifie Peachers to convince men of their Errors. But ye forget how ye contradict your ſelves in two weighty particulars, 1st, <hi>That we are past Admonition, and Incorrigible;</hi> and yet your <hi>Preaching in your publick Houſes, are means of our Conviction,</hi> but not <hi>your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with us in private Houſes:</hi> If we are paſt <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Incorrigible,</hi> how can your
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:137547:107"/> Preaching be a means of our Conviction, any more than private Conference in your private Houſes? If it be a Duty to preach to us, is it not alſo a Duty, when ye are deſired, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with us in private, at leaſt before Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? 2dly, Ye are guilty of another great Contradiction, <hi>That becauſe I am a Heretick, and worſe, ye muſt not diſpute with me, but reject me;</hi> and now at laſt ye diſpute with me in Print, that is a more open way of diſpute, than by word of Mouth; or can ye find any ground in Scripture to warrant you to diſpute with me in Print, and yet to forbid you to diſpute with me by word of Mouth?</p>
               <p>My comparing you to <hi>Turkiſh Pyrates</hi> that hang out falſe Colours, ye ſay, <hi>holds not Parrallel;</hi> but that I can freely leave to the judicious and impartial <hi>Readers.</hi> But it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, all your former Reaſons were but made or feigned, not real, why ye refuſed a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diſpute with me; therefore ye proceed to give other new Reaſons, that ye think will appear more ſollid. <hi>Firſt,</hi> therefore ye begin again to ſay, <hi>It was not in your power to grant it it to me, to have a publick Diſputation with you, without laying your ſelves obnoxious to the then Government, who had expreſly forbidden the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take liberty of any publick Meeting together on any occaſion on the week dayes, beſides the uſual</hi>

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:137547:108"/> to have allowed the time of your Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to a publick Diſpute. 2dly, If ye had given this Reaſon for your denyal at firſt, without all doubt a liberty could have been moſt readily procured unto you, from the then Government. 3dly, Many of the People took a far greater liberty afterwards, not only to meet openly, without leave of your then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but to do a great deal more, &amp;c. But if it was unlawful to diſpute with an <hi>Incorrigible Heretick,</hi> why do ye now inſinuate, that had it not been for laying your ſelves obnoxious to the then Government, ye would have given me a publick Diſputation with you? Surely ye do greatly forget your ſelves, to write ſuch Contradictions. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye ſay, <hi>Ye knew none of your Hearers had any ſcruple about your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> But what then? ye ſhould be ready to give a Reaſon of your Hope to every one that asketh you, and to convince Gain-ſayers, if they be out of the way, and ye in it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Ye ſay, <hi>Ye knew there would be no holding of me to any Law or Rule of Diſputation, partly becauſe a</hi> Quaker, <hi>and partly by Reports of me, and that I would bring all to my Revelations, &amp;c.</hi> But who ſeeth not the weakneſs and ſhallowneſs of theſe Fig-leaf Reaſons? Theſe called <hi>Quakers</hi> are known to be men of Reaſon, and many of them know as well as ye, how to hold to the true Laws of fair Diſpute, and falſe Reports of me I value not; it never was nor is my way
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:137547:108"/> to bring any matter of Diſpute (leaving the Scripture) to inward Revelation; but if I cannot prove the Doctrine, whereof I charged you to be falſe, from Scripture, I ſhould be ſilent; and Ye and the Readers may ſee, I have not left the Scriptures, and run to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Revelations (tho' I own, that without inward divine Revelation no man can have a right underſtanding of Scripture) for proof againſt you, but hold to Scripture end Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof, in a way of fair Reaſoning. 4thly, Your laſt Reaſon is as falſe as any of the reſt, <hi>That I had declared my ſelf at once in oppoſition to almoſt all the fundamental Articles of Religion, which have been maintained almoſt Seventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years by the Church of Chriſt.</hi> The falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of this will ſufficiently appear, from both my firſt, and this latter Book, to all ſober and judicious Readers. And whereas ye ſay, <hi>Who but Mad-men would expoſe theſe to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly debated?</hi> Why then have ye expoſed them that ye call <hi>Fundamentals</hi> (but are no Fundamentals of Chriſtian Doctrine, but Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Errors, that falſe Churches have been built upon) now to be publickly debated? Why do ye thus declare your ſelves, by your own confeſſion, to be ſuch <hi>Mad-men,</hi> to debate them ſo openly in the face of the Nations, both in <hi>America</hi> &amp; <hi>Europe,</hi> yea, much more openly than they could have been by 2 or 3 hours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe before two or three hundred People?
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:137547:109"/> And that ye your ſelves gave the riſe to this ſo publick way of diſputing in Print, is evident from the words of your Letter, ſaying, <hi>If he would have a publick Audience let him Print.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I deſire the Reader to take notice, That what Teſtimonies of antient or latter Writers of good eſteem among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> I have cited in this Treatiſe, is not for want of ſufficient proofs of Scripture Teſtimony, on every head of difference betwixt our Oppoſers and us; for I have brought ſufficient Teſtimonies of holy Scripture to confirm every one of theſe heads, as the judicious and impartial Reader may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in both my Treatiſes; but becauſe theſe men who are our Oppoſers, thinking to render our Doctrine odious, do accuſe it, either as <hi>Novel,</hi> or as <hi>Old Hereſies revived by us, and as contradicting almoſt all Fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion for almoſt Seventeen Hundred Years paſt, held by good Chriſtians;</hi> Therefore I found it convenient to cite theſe Teſtimonies, to ſhow our agreement, not only with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but alſo with other Writers of good eſteem among <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> even in theſe very Heads, called by our Oppoſers <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> that their Ignorance and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality may appear, and their evil Deſign to render the Truth Odious, may be diſcovered.</p>

               <p>In the end, I deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to take notice how that after C.

            <p>AMong the many Writers this ſcribling Age hath furniſh't the World with, there is none in theſe <hi>American</hi> parts hath been ſo buſie as one <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> a pretended Miniſter of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:137547:110"/> the Goſpel in <hi>Boſton,</hi> whoſe publick Diſcourſes in print ſufficiently evince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to the ſerious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible] Reader, how little reaſon himſelf hath to aſſume that Title, or his Brethren to confer it upon him. I ſhall only at this time take notice, as the Lord ſhall aſſiſt me, of that, by him ſent forth to publick view, under this Title, <hi>The Serviceable Man, A Diſcourſe made unto the general Court of the Maſſachuſets Colony in</hi> New-England, <hi>at the anniverſary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection the</hi> 28th <hi>of the</hi> 3d <hi>Mo.</hi> 1690. The ſtile, tendency and purport of this Diſcourſe more reſembles the Harangues of a Mountebank or Comedian, than of a ſerious ſober <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> much leſs a Miniſter of Chriſt; its plain, this Author hath been more ſolicitous to pleaſe the Ears of his credulous Auditors, than to conſult how Truth would vindicate his Aſſertions, as appears partly by his Self-Contradictions, and alſo by his falſe malitious Slanders and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of an innocent People, by him and others in ſcorn call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> whoſe Principles he is either unacquainted with, or elſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverts them; if the firſt, he manifeſts his Ignorance, if the latter, his Envy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, both ill Companions for a Miniſter of Chriſt. In proof of his Self-Contradiction, read pag. 28. of his ſaid Book, compared with pag. 57.</p>
            <p>Pag. 28. thus, <hi>'Tis the Prerogative of</hi> New-England, <hi>above all the Countries of the World,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:137547:110"/> That it is a Plantation for the Chriſtian &amp; Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion: You may now ſee a Land filled with Churches, which by ſolemn and aweful Covenants are dedicated unto the Son of God; there are, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, more than an hundred of theſe holy Societies among us, which would in</hi> Luthers <hi>judgment ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the meanest Villiage more glorious than an Ivory Palace; in theſe you may ſee Diſcipline ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, Hereſie ſubdued, Prophaneſs oppoſed, and Communion maintained, with a careful reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Word of God in all; you may ſee faithful Ministers and ſincere Chriſtians, and multitudes of Souls ripening a pace for the Kingdom of God; you may ſee proportionably as much of God among them, as in any spot of Ground which the Children of</hi> Adam <hi>walk upon.</hi> This is greatly in praiſe of <hi>N. England,</hi> if he had not as fully &amp; amply contradicted it, p. 57. in this manner; <hi>But if our Fathers were to write unto us from that Heaven unto which they are gone, I am thinking what they would ſay; Would they not write in very diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Terms unto us, and ſay, Alas! you don't walk in our wayes: we left in your Hands, a work to be done for the People of God; but you have thrown by that work, and found ſomething elſe to be concern'd about. We hop'd that you would have trod in our Steps, and that we ſhould have ſhortly congratulated your Arrival to the Glorious place, which we are Triumphing in; But we now fear, That we have dropt you and lost you forever; and that we ſhall never ſee you more, till we behold you
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:137547:111"/> wringing your Hands and Gnaſhing your Teeth among the Goats at the Left Hand of the Lord Jeſus in the Day of His Appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what this Writer ſo confidently affirmed before were undeniably true, let the Reader judge, how unlikely it is, an Epiſtle from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould be filled with ſuch Contents againſt ſo holy a People; and for the future the Author will do well to avoid the like Contradictions. It cannot be counted Breach of Charity in me, or any other, to give greater credit to what I am ready, with him, to believe would be the Contents of an Epiſtle from Heaven, from ſuch of their Fathers as are gone unto thoſe heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manſions, prepared for them by our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, than unto this Author's Character, directly Contradictory hereunto.</p>
            <p>This Author hath plentifully vented his Envy and Malice againſt an innocent quiet peaceable People, whoſe behaviour under all Governments (where by the Providence of God they have had their abode) hath been ſuch as loudly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays the bitter Invictives belched forth againſt them by this Satirical Author in pag. 34, 35, 36. of his book: I ſhall cite the Paſſages verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim, and ſo make ſome ſhort Reply.</p>

                  <p>While theſe Enemies are ſeeking to involve our Civil Concerns in Confuſion, there are Sectaries and Seducers that are uſing their Batt'ring Rams

                  <p>Here is a heavy Charge againſt an innocent People, that they are not only <hi>Sectaries</hi> and <hi>Seducers,</hi> but the <hi>moſt Malicious</hi> and <hi>Pernicious Enemies</hi> among thoſe. Were this as firmly proved as 'tis boldly aſſerted, it were enough to render us Odious: Its no leſs juſt than ſtrange, this man ſhould be ſo infatuated, as to imagine, thoſe many thouſands, unto whom his Diſcourſe is made publick by print, ſhould be ſo eaſily impoſed upon as his credulous Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were that day; for may not by this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reaſoning, without the leaſt ſhadow of proof, the beſt of Societies, as well as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men be groſly abuſed: A Method the Papiſts-uſe againſt the Proteſtants.</p>

                  <p>They were once in a ready way to have broken up all the Good Order whether Civil or Sacred, in the Infancy of this Plantation; which occaſioned the Authority whom they would have undermined, then to turn a Sharp upon them, by Laws not ſo ſevere as thoſe in the Realm of <hi>England</hi> againſt (their Fathers) the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> on the ſame Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: yet thoſe Troubleſom Hereticks, who had no Buſineſs here at all, but the overthrowing of our whole Government, would puſh themſelves on the Swords point; and tho' repeated Baniſhments

                  <p>How or after what manner the Plantation in its infancy was in ſuch danger, our Author is ſilent in: True it is, that upwards of thirty Years paſt, ſome of our Friends, as faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, in obedience to their Lord and Maſters command, the great <hi>God</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> by the ſpirit of his Son in their hearts, did viſit <hi>N. England</hi> in true and tender Love to the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for whoſe Immortal Wellfare they earneſtly travailed, and were bowed down before the Lord, &amp; being amongſt them in much broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Heart and contrition of Spirit, they were grieved and weighted in their Souls with the Hypocriſie in <hi>New-England,</hi> againſt which they witneſſed, ſealing it with their Blood, their hearts being filled with that Meſſage the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his day, was imployed in, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. <hi>To open their Eyes, and to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God,</hi> directing them to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Spirit of God in them; A Teacher not to be removed into a corner, nor that would any ways deceive them, or ſuffer them to be at eaſe in ſin: This High way of the Lord, caſt up in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the World, the Sound thereof offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:137547:112"/> the Ears of <hi>New-England</hi>'s Teachers, who not unlike <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-ſmith, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.24. proved notable Incendiaries againſt the Lords Servants, left their craft ſhould be in danger, ſo far did they kindle the Rage and Fury of their bigotted Rulers, that by cruel Uſage and inhumane Laws they far exceeded any thing in the Realm of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Jeſuites. And whilſt I am writing, there livingly ſprings up in my heart, to you the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Boſton</hi> &amp; <hi>New-England,</hi> a weighty Exhortation, and that in tender Love, That you would mind the Grace of God that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation, and as the holy Scripture teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, hath appeared unto all men, 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 11. that in the ſame you may ſee your blind Guides, for if the Blind lead the Blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch: Beware that it be not your Condemnation that Light is come into the World, and that you love Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe your Deeds are Evil: I have neither Envy nor Malice againſt the Prieſts or People of <hi>New-England,</hi> but earneſtly deſire the Eternal Well-fare of both; yet I cannot but lament the preſent ſtate of <hi>New-England,</hi> as well as its former, whoſe Prieſts, to the life, are drawn out in the 3d of <hi>Micah, v.</hi> 5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my People Err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and he that putteth not into their Mouthes, they even prepare War againſt him;</hi> &amp;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:137547:113"/> verſ. 11. <hi>The Heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Prieſts thereof Teach for Hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for Money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord among us? none Evil can come upon us.</hi> O <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land! New-England!</hi> is not this your preſent ſtate? Are not your Prieſts crying Peace unto you, as if no Evil could come upon you, in the midſt of theſe Cloudes of Dangers that are hanging over your heads? ſome of them you have, for more than a Twelve Moneth felt, to wit, A Bloody &amp; Cruel War with the Heathen, the loſs of ſo many Lives hath humbled me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and at this time the earneſt Cry and Supplication of my Soul unto God, is, That you may by your ſpeedy &amp; ſincere Repentance unto him, prevent his Judgments for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> may be properly term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fathers of <hi>New-England</hi> Prieſts, none can doubt, if they differ not from their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>John Cotton</hi> of <hi>Hampton,</hi> who in a publick Diſpute with <hi>G. K.</hi> owned, <hi>To have received his Miniſtry by the Pope of Rome,</hi> whoſe Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries they are. Beſide, as they can never prove the <hi>Quakers</hi> guilty of any one Jeſuitical Error, yet we can prove theſe Prieſts of <hi>Boſton</hi> guilty of many, and more eſpecially in their being Incendiaries, againſt the Peace of the Government. The further calumniating thoſe who ſuffered Death, to anſwer your Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, is but a mean way to expiate the Crime
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:137547:113"/> of their innocent Blood, which crys aloud for Vengeance, and the Lord, unto whom it belongs will repay it. Thou <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> nor all thy Fraternity will never be able to prove theſe 4 Worthies troubleſom Hereticks, that patiently endured Martyrdom for the Teſtimony of Jeſus, by their crul Hands; neither will thy poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation help, <hi>That two or three of them would rather dye, than leave the Plantation undiſturbed.</hi> They had no reaſon to hearken unto your Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical entreaties to be gone, it was their Birth-right, as free-born Subjects of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo might claim it to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit <hi>N. England,</hi> as well as any that there reſided, as not being forbid to them by either the Law of God, or the Realm of <hi>England;</hi> ſo that being innocent, they feared not man, that could only hurt the Body, but feared him that could caſt both Body and Soul into Hell Fire.</p>
